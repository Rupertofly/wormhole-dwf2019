# Wormhole: An Exquisite Digital Corpse

A wormhole has sucked up some of the best young writing in Australia and New Zealand and regurgitated an exquisite corpse for the digital era.

This collaborative multimedia piece joins together four young artists from Voiceworks Online and Starling literary journals, combining text, video, audio and code. Each artist will independently respond to the theme ‘wormhole’, with the final work coming together as an emergent, collaborative piece of digital debris.

Featuring work by Sinead Overbye, [Veronica Charmont](https://vimeo.com/user80148916), [Ruby Mae Hinepunui Solly](http://www.facebook.com/rubysollymusic) and [Ruby Quail](https://rubyquail.design).

Presented in partnership with Voiceworks and Starling
